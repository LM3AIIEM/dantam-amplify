## Data Flow
```
Patient List ‚Üí Click Patient ‚Üí /clinical/[id] ‚Üí Unified View
                                                     ‚Üì
                                              All patient data
                                              + Clinical work
                                              + Quick actions
```

## Case Sheet Structure
Following the stakeholder requirements, the case sheet maintains:
- **Chronological Order** - All entries in time sequence
- **Universal Notes** - Any entry can have notes/attachments
- **Tooth-Centric** - Most actions linked to specific teeth

## Integration Points
- Uses shared patient data from `/shared/mock-patients.json`
- Reuses UI components from `/components/ui`
- Follows Indian localization (INR, phone formats)
- Compatible with existing patient management module

## Usage Example
```tsx
import { UnifiedPatientClinicalView } from '@/modules/unified-clinical';

// In your page component
<UnifiedPatientClinicalView patientId={1} />
```
